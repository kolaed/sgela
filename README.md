## About App

Sgela is a crowdfunding app for high-schools the idea is to leverage past Alumni of the school to
contribute to the upliftment and betterment of their schools.

We all know that south africa is very unequal i feel that education is the best chance for anyone to
change their circumstances,

and as former students of disadvantaged schools we have a opportunity to uplift our schools and make
things better for the next generation.

the school will post a project(.e.g Painting the school, equipment for a science lab or even
renovation of sports grounds) the users will pledge any amount towards the project until the goal is
reached.
